/**
 * @title EmergencyWithdrawYieldLossTest
 * @notice Proof-of-concept test demonstrating yield loss after emergency withdrawal
 * @dev Tests vulnerability L1 from security audit report
 *
 * VULNERABILITY: _emergencyWithdraw does not re-stake remaining shares after partial withdrawal
 *
 * IMPACT:
 * - Remaining shares sit unstaked in the contract
 * - No longer earning TOKE rewards
 * - Yield generation stops for remaining user funds
 *
 * SEVERITY: LOW (funds safe, but yield impaired)
