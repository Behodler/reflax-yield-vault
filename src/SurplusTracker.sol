     * @notice Calculate the surplus for a given client in a vault
     * @param vault The vault address
     * @param token The token address
     * @param client The client address
     * @param clientInternalBalance The client's internal accounting balance
     * @return The surplus amount (vault balance - client internal balance)
     * @dev Surplus represents yield that has accrued in the vault but is not tracked in client's internal accounting
     *      For example: Behodler's virtualInputTokens (internal) vs vault's totalBalanceOf (actual with yield)
     *
     *      The function compares:
     *      - vaultBalance: The actual balance in the vault (includes accumulated yield via totalBalanceOf())
     *      - clientInternalBalance: What the client thinks they have (from their internal accounting)
     *
     *      We use totalBalanceOf() instead of balanceOf() to ensure we capture the full balance including
     *      accumulated yield. The balanceOf() method is deprecated due to ambiguous semantics (some implementations
     *      return principal only, others return principal+yield). totalBalanceOf() explicitly returns principal+yield,
     *      which is what we need to correctly calculate surplus yield for extraction.
     *
     *      If vaultBalance > clientInternalBalance, the difference is the surplus (harvestable yield)
     *      If vaultBalance <= clientInternalBalance, there is no surplus (returns 0)
